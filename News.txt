The Righteous Developer Build 
=============================
NEWS (12/7/14)

Righteous XT
--
XT, standing for eXTensible, is the name of the software used to test game logic before the full 3D version of The Righteous
this version is very much intended to be easily modifiable in which it is easy to simply "pop" features with ease and
"push" new features all with the subsystems like memory intact. Thus I suggest not modifying the code to this and instead
modify the "CurrentDevBuild" folder instead.

Features implemented with latest build:

Combat core is modified to use the Battle Junction system instead of only a traditional SRPG system. 
The Battle Junction system is intended to be like a turn-based battle network like battle system focused
on engaging the player in traditionally turn based combat.

User interface has additional items added to reflect future development goals.


To-Do:
a full fledged State Manager will be needed. State Machine can use further tweaking to reflect special conditions in battle
battle skills, and mechanics.

The old version had the skeleton of a market that would need further modification to fully work in the current version
Market will be needed to buy new parts, test different part types and sell parts along with weapons, etc. 

Pilots, Weapons, Items and entites need reimplementation in this version, past code can be used for reference.
